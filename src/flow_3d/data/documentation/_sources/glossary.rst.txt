   Baffles
      Two-dimensional objects that are used to represent thin pieces of geometry.  They are moved by the preprocessor to cell faces and act to partially, or completely block the flow of fluid. Baffles can  have heat transfer coefficients specified and can be used to measure quantities that pass through them (a flux surface).

   Boundary conditions
      Defines the solution at the extents of the domain. It is important to choose boundary conditions that represent the true condition of the flow at the boundary location.

   CFD
      Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), the branch of fluid mechanics dedicated to simulating the flow of fluid on a computer via numerical solutions.

   Client
      A client machine is a computer that runs |prod| but acquires the software license from a different machine (the server machine)

   Complements
      The inverse of a shape defines the complement. For example, the complement of a solid sphere is a spherical hole surrounded by solid material.  

   Components
      Components define objects in space and are comprised of subcomponents. A component can have material properties such as thermal conductivity, specific heat and surface roughness.

   Custom result
      Graphical displays of data generated by the user during the simulation or after it has completed. To generate, the user must open an :file:`flsgrf` results file and then select the plotting parameter (e.g., portion of domain to plot, quantity to plot, etc.).

   Domain
      The region in which the governing equations are to be solved.  This is defined by the extents of the mesh.

   Diagnostics
      A suite of files that contain information on the progress of the preprocessor and solver as well as errors and warnings.

   EPSI
      The convergence criterion that was used to determine at what point the pressure/continuity iterations have converged. With the default numerical settings, this value is automatically computed by |prod| and becomes smaller as the time step increases.

   Existing result
      A plot file that is automatically created, either at the end of preprocessing or the end of the solver run- :file:`prpplt.*` or :file:`flsplt.*`.

   F3D_HOME
      Environment variable that defines the directory where the |prod| program files are located.

   Floating license
      A license that allows |prod| to be run on a network of computers with each client machine accessing the license on a server machine. The maximum number of concurrent simulations is limited by the number of solver tokens purchased.

   Flsgrf file
      Results file produced by the solver. This file contains information produced at predefined time intervals and is used to produce graphical displays. Used by the postprocessor during custom plotting.

   Flsplt file
      Plot file produced automatically by the solver. This file contains basic information on history data, mesh, etc. from the simulation as well as any pre-defined graphics requests in the $GRAFIC namelist in :file:`prepin.*`.

   Fluid #1 surface area
      The free-surface area in the chosen length units squared. This is only relevant for problems with a sharp interface.

   Fluid thermal energy
      The total thermal energy contained by all the fluid present in the domain (relevant only for simulations with energy transport turned on).

   Free surface
      The interface between fluid and void. In |prod|, this interface is assumed to be shear-free, meaning that any gas in the void space exerted negligible traction on the fluid.

   GUI
      "Graphical User Interface". The GUI presents the graphical panels, dialog boxes and windows that allow the user to control |prod|.

   Iteration count
      The number of pressure/continuity iterations required at each time step. The pressure/continuity iterations are necessary to ensure that the fluid volume is maintained and to compute the correct pressure throughout the fluid.

   License file
      Electronic file provided by Flow Science that contains encrypted information enabling the user to run |prod|.

   License server
      Computer on which the FLEXlm licensing software is installed to enable the operation of a floating license system. |prod| does not need to be installed on the license server.

   Licensing
      FLEXlm software that controls the running of |prod|.

   Max. residual
      The actual divergence of the continuity equation on the final iteration of the pressure/continuity iterations. This value is usually smaller than epsi unless the message, ``pressure iteration did not converge in xxxx iterations`` appears.

   Mean kinetic energy
      The sum of kinetic energy of all the computational cells, divided by the total mass of fluid present in the domain. When this quantity ceases to change over time, it is a good indicator that steady-state has been reached.

   Node-locked license
      A license that is locked to a particular computer. A node-locked license cannot be accessed across a network, and so is typically only used when all work is to be done on one computer.

   Non-inertial reference frame
      A frame of reference that is accelerating. A non-inertial reference frame can be used to mimic a moving container.

   Pltfsi
      Graphics display program included with |prod| that produces 1D and 2D plots.

   Postprocessor
      The program within |prod| that processes the solver output data to produce data files that can be read by |prod|'s or third-party's visualization programs, or produce text data to be read by third party software programs.

   Prepin file
      Text file that contains all of the information necessary to create a |prod| simulation. It can be created using the GUI or manually with a text editor.

   Preprocessor
      The program within |prod| that generates the mesh and initial conditions based on the input file in preparation for the running of the solver.

   Prpgrf file
      Results file produced by the preprocessor. Contains information from the preprocessor and can be used by the postprocessor to create custom plots. This file is produced only when the Preview button is selected or if only the pre-processor is run on the simulation (using runpre).

   Prpplt file
      Plot file produced automatically by the preprocessor. Contains information on meshing, components, initial conditions and material properties.

   Restart simulation
      A simulation which continues from a previous simulation. The results from the previous simulation are used to generate the initial conditions and (optionally) boundary conditions for the restart simulation. 

   Server
      The machine that hosts the license server.

   Solid fraction
      The fraction of fluid in the domain that has become solidified (relevant only for simulations where the solidification model has been turned on).

   Solver
      The program within |prod| that solves the system of equations that simulate the flow problem defined in the input file.

   Stability limit
      The maximum time step that can be used during each time step. A larger time step will lead to numerical instabilities and nonphysical results.

   STL (Stereolithography) File
      The :file:`.STL` file format is a standard data transmission format that approximates the surfaces of a solid model with a series of triangles.  The triangles must join at the edges and must have normals that point in a consistent direction.

   STL Viewer
      A special utility that displays stereolithography (STL) files. STL files are produced by CAD software and are composed of many triangles that form the surface of a three-dimensional object. The STL Viewer in |prod| is accessible via the GUI by clicking Utilities/STL Viewer in the main menu. This causes the viewer to open in a separate window. STL files can also be opened and viewed in the Meshing and Geometry tab.

   Subcomponents
      Subcomponents are geometric shapes that can be combined to form larger shapes, called components.  A subcomponent can be defined to add material (as solids), remove material from other subcomponents (as holes), or add material outside of the shape (as a complement).

   Time-step size
      The actual time step used in the computation. This value can be equal to or less than the stability limit.

   Units
      Units are based upon the values set for the physical properties. Items such as mesh block extents and cell lengths automatically conform to the units used for setting these physical properties.

   Volume error (%)
      The percentage of fluid volume not accounted for as a percentage of the total fluid present in the domain at a given time. Therefore, a large percentage volume error can occur for simulations where fluid is draining out of the system simply because the total volume present is small.

   Volume of fluid #1
      The total volume of fluid #1 present in the system, in the chosen length units cubed. For two-fluid problems, the volume of fluid #2 is always the domain volume minus the volume of fluid #1.

   Wall shear stress
      The |prod| option that allows the user to turn on or off the computation of shear stress at wall and object interfaces. Wall shear stress must be turned on to model the effect of "no-slip" interfaces.

   Workspace
      A workspace is a file container for simulation projects. Workspaces help the user organize their work, not only within |prod|, but also on their hard drive.
