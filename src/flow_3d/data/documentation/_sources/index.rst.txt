   All input files that were created in previous versions of |prod| should be
   checked for deprecated parameters and updated. This can be done by
   loading the input file into the user interface, at which point the
   automatic file converter will updated the file and write a log describing
   the changes without altering the original file.  However, the file
   converter in the user interface may not be able to update all parameters in
   input files that are several versions older than |prodv|, so some older
   input files may require manual updating.
