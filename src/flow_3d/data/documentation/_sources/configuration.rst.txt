Preferences
=====================================

The :guilabel:`Preferences` drop-down menu allows users to control default settings for
file locations, remote simulation, etc.  A brief description of the options is given below:

.. rubric:: Visuals

* :menuselection:`Sub-tab Color`:  This option allows sub-tabs, e.g. :guilabel:`Meshing & Geometry` 
  to be colored differently from the main tabs for easy identification.
* :menuselection:`Use default screen resolution for snapshots`:  Allows for user-defined 
  screenshot resolutions.
* :menuselection:`Set Font for Simulation Output Text and General/Notes`:
  Choose the display font for the output text and the notes.
* :menuselection:`Show Simulation Information in Simulation Manager`:  Shows/hides
  the diagnostic text at the bottom of the :guilabel:`Simulation Manager`.  

.. rubric:: File management

* :menuselection:`Default Workspace Location`:  This allows the user to choose the 
  default location where workspaces will be created. 
* :menuselection:`Add Existing Simulation starts in Workspace`:  This determines whether
  the :menuselection:`Add Existing Simulation` dialog opens in the folder containing the 
  currently selected workspace or not.
* :menuselection:`Project Creation/Copy Options`:  This controls the file system
  structure for simulations and what is copied between simulations.  
* :menuselection:`Autosave Options`:  Controls how frequently the simulation setup
  is saved automatically.
* :menuselection:`Auto-raise Project/Results File Dialog`:  Prompt user
  to load a new results file if the simulation that is selected on the 
  :guilabel:`Simulation Manager` does not match the results file that is open
  on the :guilabel:`Analyze` tab.
* :menuselection:`Load Simulations When Opening Workspace`:  Option to automatically
  load simulations into memory when a workspace is opened.

.. rubric:: Simulation settings

* :menuselection:`Default Version Options`:  This allows the user to choose the 
  default :ref:`versionoptionsms` for the local machine and all remote machines.
  :guilabel:`Run With Available` provides permission to the solver to run with less core/license 
  resources than requested. This is useful when there are other simulations running and 
  or core resources are limited to less than requested number of processors. 
* :menuselection:`Simulation Pre-Check Tolerance`:  This is the default tolerance for 
  the :ref:`matpropscheck` in the :ref:`simprecheck`.
* :menuselection:`Set Default Selected Parameters for Selected Data in Output`:
  Choose which variables will be output by default in the :ref:`Selected Data <selectedData>`.
* :menuselection:`Model Setup`: The visuals of the widgets in :guilabel:`Model Setup` can be modified 
  here to show or hide labels on the process toolbar. Additionally, the user saved preferences of the :guilabel:`Model Setup` layout
  can be reset to the default configuration.
* :menuselection:`Simulation Default Settings`: This allows the user to define the standard units
  and pressure reference applied by default to new simulations. If custom units are desired, those can be selected here. Custom units cannot be displayed in post processing on the scale in the :guilabel:`Display` tab.

.. rubric:: Communications

* :menuselection:`Remote Simulation Preferences`:  This gives access to the 
  :ref:`RemoteSolvingSetup` controls, including those for :ref:`Remote Server Registration <clientremote>`
  and :ref:`leaving the results on the remote machine <clientremote>`.
* :menuselection:`Local Queue Communications Settings`:  This allows for the configuration
  of the local queue settings, including the port number.

.. rubric:: Databases

* :menuselection:`Location`:  This allows users to add and remove each :ref:`matdbms`. 
  At the first launch of |prod| after installation, a prompt will include selection
  of any preexisting :ref:`matdbms` locations to include. The :menuselection:`Location` 
  menu provides user control for each database that is stored at a local or network location.
